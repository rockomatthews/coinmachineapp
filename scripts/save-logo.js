=== CoinBull Logo Update Instructions ===

To update the logo image:

1. Download the bull image shown in the conversation
2. Save it to: public/images/logo.png (replace the existing file)

The changes to use the new app name have already been applied:
- Updated page titles and metadata to "CoinBull.app"
- Fixed the Content Security Policy to allow Pinata API calls
- Updated IPFS proxy configurations

After saving the image, restart your development server or redeploy
to see the changes take effect.
