# Raydium Integration Guide

This document provides guidance on integrating with Raydium AMM for creating liquidity pools with your tokens.

## Overview

## Prerequisites

## Steps to Create a Liquidity Pool

1. Create your token using Coin Machine
2. Navigate to the Raydium interface
3. Connect your wallet
4. Select "Liquidity" > "Create New Pool"

6. Set your initial liquidity amount
7. Review and confirm the transaction

## Tips for Successful Pool Creation

- Start with a reasonable amount of liquidity to minimize price impact
- Consider the initial price carefully - this sets the market value
- Monitor your pool regularly to adjust liquidity as needed
